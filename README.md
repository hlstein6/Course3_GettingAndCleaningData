The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set as part of the Coursera data science cource, Get and Cleaning Data.  The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The original data raw data set is found at:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script, run_anaysis.R, uses the original raw data and does the following:
	merges the training and test sets to create one data set
	extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measurement
	uses descriptive activity names
	appropriatly labels the variable names in the data set
	
	From this combined dataset, a second dataset is created that is an independent tidy data set with the  average for each activity and each subject.

In addition, CodeBook.md contains the description of the context, transformations and variable descriptions involved.
